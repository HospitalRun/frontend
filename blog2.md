Contributing to My First Open Source Project
===================

Since first joining the open source project HospitalRun they have made a few updates and changes. They now use scss-lint in order to standardize and check all CSS contributions are following the right style. The community has been great and continues to be helpful whenever issues arise, or I have difficulties understanding something. They use handlebars for their templates which took a little bit to understand as I had never seen it before. It seems kind of similar to Laravel with injections into standard HTML in order to simplify the code. The issue I fixed was issue #322 and it was to remove the redunent labels on checkboxes. This was a simple issue to fix, and I chose it because contributing to an open source project is still quite daunting. HospitalRun use TravisCI, which we talked about in class. The way HospitalRun uses it is to make a build whenever you perform a pull request. You can check the details of the TravisCI build by going to a pull request opening the "Show all checks" link and selecting "Details". This was really neat because we talked a lot in class about continuous integration and its importance. Being able to see the results and notice it being used on a project really highlights the use of it in out of classroom experiences. This projet was really interesting as it shows the importance of contributing to code in the real world and outside of school.
